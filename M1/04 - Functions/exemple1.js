/* 2) BMI â€“ Body Mass Index is a World Health Organization criterion to give an indication of an adult's weight status.

BMI formula:
BMI = weight / (height * height)

Create an algorithm that, given the weight and height of an adult, shows their condition according to the table below.

BMI in adults Condition:
- Below 18.5 Underweight;
- Between 18.5 and 25 normal weight;
- Between 25 and 30 Overweight;
- Between 30 and 40 Obese;
- Above 40 Severe Obsesity;
